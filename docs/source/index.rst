Py3DViewer Documentation
===============================

Py3DViewer is a Python library based on Numpy for fast prototyping of geometry processing algorithms. It is developed to work in pair with
Ipython notebooks (e.g. Jupyter Notebooks) and it is capable of working with both surface and volumetric meshes.
It is composed of 5 data structures (triangle meshes, quad meshes, tet meshes, hex meshes and curve skeletons) and a visualizer that consent the
user to visualize one of the aforementioned  structures in an easy and quick way. The visualizer integrates some useful functionalities such as
mesh cutting along an axis, color selection, quality visualization and more.
