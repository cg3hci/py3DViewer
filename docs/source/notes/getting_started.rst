Getting Started
===============

The library is designed to be easy and quick to use in the context of fast prototyping. In the example below it is shown how a mesh can be loaded from a file and drawn in a canvas with just a few lines of code.


.. code-block:: python
    
    from Py3DViewer import Trimesh
    m = Trimesh('data/goyle_tris.obj')
    m.show()
