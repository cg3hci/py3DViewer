Getting Started
===============

The library is designed to be easy and quick to use in the context of fast prototyping. In the example below it is shown how a mesh can be loaded from a file and drawn in a canvas with just a few linesof code.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from Py3DViewer import Trimesh
    m = Trimesh('data/goyle.obj')
    m.show()
    
    
    More examples are available `here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cg3hci/py3dviewer/master?filepath=Playground.ipynb>`_.
